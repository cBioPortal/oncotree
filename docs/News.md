 *   **Oncotree format expanded to support deeper tree nodes**
        * To support upcoming expansion of the oncotree, the 5 named levels of the oncotree {*Primary*, *Secondary*, *Tertiary*, *Quaternary*, *Quinternary*} have been dropped in favor of level numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}. Web API functions have been adjusted accordingly, and an API function which outputs a table format of the oncotree has been adjusted to output 7 levels of depth.
