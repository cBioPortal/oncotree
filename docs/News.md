#### November 4, 2020
 *   **Ontology to Ontology Mapping tool available**
     * The Ontology Mapping tool was developed to facilitate the mapping between different cancer classification systems. We currently support mapping between OncoTree, ICD-O, NCIt, UMLS and HemeOnc systems.
     * A mapping file containing mappings between the different ontologies and OncoTree codes as well as a python script to run the mapping is available on the OncoTree [GitHub page <span class="text-primary oi oi-external-link"></span>](https://github.com/cBioPortal/oncotree/tree/master/scripts/ontology_to_ontology_mapping_tool). Details are also available on the [Mapping Tools page <span class="text-primary oi oi-external-link"></span>](http://oncotree.info/images/../#/home?tab=mapping).
     * The mapping file is expected to grow as we curate more ontology mappings for OncoTree codes.

         * it now is able to handle input files where lines end in carriage return (such as files saved from Microsoft Excel)
#### May 1, 2019
 *   **New Stable Release** OncoTree version *oncotree_2019_05_01* is now the latest stable release. The previous stable version is still accessible as version *oncotree_2019_03_01*.
 *   **Nodes reclassified**

#### March 26, 2019
 *   **OncoTree-to-OncoTree code mapping tool updated**
     * The OncoTree-to-OncoTree mapping tool (now version 1.1) has been slightly improved, mainly by adding a separate section in the output summary for reporting OncoTree codes which were replaced automatically. Also, additional documentation and description of the tool has been added under the "Mapping Tools" tab.
#### March 14, 2019
 *   **OncoTree-to-OncoTree code mapping tool available**
     * A python program is now available for download under the webpage tab labeled "Mapping Tools". This tool will rewrite OncoTree codes in a tabular clinical data file, mapping from one version of OncoTree to another. When additional guidance is necessary, the program will insert a column containing options and comments next to the ONCOTREE_CODE column. After selecting an appropriate OncoTree code for cases which require action, this extra column can be deleted to produce a fully re-mapped clinical data file. More details about this tool and how to use it are available under the "Mapping Tools" tab.
     * The OncoTree-to-OncoTree mapping tool relies on an expanded model of OncoTree node history. This is reflected in the Web API schema for Tumor Types, which now has added properties called "precursors" and "revocations". Using these properties, and the existing "history" property, the tool is able to make proper mappings across OncoTree versions, and give suggestions when no clear mapping is available. It is also reflected in the main tree visualization of OncoTree, where a combination of these properties (when set) will be displayed in the pop-up information box with label "Previous Codes".
#### March 1, 2019
 *   **New Stable Release** OncoTree version *oncotree_2019_03_01* is now the latest stable release. The previous stable version is still accessible as version *oncotree_2019_02_01*.
 *   **New node added:**
     * NUT Carcinoma of the Lung (NUTCL)
 *   **Node with renamed OncoTree code:**
     * Monomorphic Epitheliotropic Intestinal T-Cell Lymphoma (MEITL) [previously: MEATL]
 *   **Node with renamed OncoTree code and updated name:**
     * Germ Cell Tumor with Somatic-Type Malignancy (GCTSTM) [previously: Teratoma with Malignant Transformation (TMT)]
 *   **Cross-version OncoTree code mapping tool coming soon**
     * Development of a tool to map OncoTree codes between different versions of OncoTree is nearing completion.
     * <span class="oi oi-warning text-danger" aria-hidden="true"></span> Related to this, users of the OncoTree Web API should be aware that we will soon be adding two additional properties to the output schema returned by the api/tumorTypes endpoints. The properties "precursors" and "revocations" will be added alongside the "history" property (having the same type: an array of strings). These will help distinguish the kinds of possible relationships to OncoTree nodes in prior versions of OncoTree. We expect this new schema to be backwards compatible, but if your language or tools requires an exactly matching JSON schema you will need to make adjustments.

#### April 23, 2018
 *   **New Web API Version Available**
     * A new version (v1.0.0) of the OncoTree Web API is available. It can be explored here:
http://oncotree.mskcc.org/swagger-ui.html <br> The previous version is still available, but is scheduled to be discontinued May 31, 2018
You can continue to access the previous version (v0.0.1) in its original location summarized here: ~~http://oncotree.mskcc.org/oncotree/swagger-ui.html~~
 *   **Details and Migration Guidance**
     * The base URL for accessing all API functionality is being simplified from ~~http://oncotree.mskcc.org/oncotree/~~ to http://oncotree.mskcc.org/
     * <span class="oi oi-warning text-danger" aria-hidden="true"></span> The /api/tumor_types.txt endpoint is now deprecated. It is scheduled for deletion as part of the next API version release.
     * Most endpoint paths in the API remain the same and provide the same services. Exceptions are:
         * /api/tumorTypes used to accept a query parameter ("flat") which controlled the output format for receiving a tree representation or a flat representation of the full set of TumorTypes. Now this endpoint always returns a flat list of all TumorTypes and a new endpoint path (/api/tumorTypes/tree) is used to retrieve a tree representation of the OncoTree. Previous requests which included "flat=false" should be adjusted to use the /api/tumorTypes/tree endpoint. Otherwise "flat=true" should be dropped from the request.
         * /api/tumorTypes used to accept a query parameter ("deprecated") which is no longer recognized. This parameter should be dropped from requests. Deprecated OncoTree codes can instead be found in the history attribute of the response.
         * the POST request endpoint (/api/tumorTypes/search) which accepted a list of TumorType queries has been deprecated and is no longer available through the swagger-ui interface. The GET request endpoint /api/tumorTypes/search/{type}/{query} remains available as before. If you previously submitted an array of query requests, you should iterate through the array and call the GET request endpoint to make one query per request.
     * The output format (schema) of many endpoints has been simplified. You will need to adjust your result handling accordingly. Changes include:
         * responses no longer include a "meta" element with associated code and error messages. Instead HTTP status codes are set appropriately and error messages are supplied in message bodies. Responses also no longer contain a "data" element. Objects representing the API output are directly returned instead.
         * MainType values are no longer modeled as objects. Each MainType value is now represented as a simple string. The /api/mainTypes endpoint now returns an array of strings rather than an object mapping MainType names to MainType objects.
         * TumorType values no longer contain elements "id", "deprecated", "links", "NCI", "UMLS". A new element ("externalReferences") has been added which contains a JSON object mapping external authority names to arrays of associated identifiers. Such as "externalReferences": {"UMLS": ["CL497188","C1510796"],"NCI": ["C123384","C40361"]}
     * Argument validation has been strengthened for several parameters, such as "type" and "levels" in the /api/tumorTypes/search/{type}/{query} endpoint. Now improper arguments cause an a HTTP status response indicating error, with a description of the problem in the body.
     * Some requests which fail to find matching entities now return NOT_FOUND HTTP status code 404 rather than an empty result. Examples: http://oncotree.mskcc.org/api/tumorTypes/search/code/TEST_UNDEFINED_CODE or http://oncotree.mskcc.org/api/crosswalk?vocabularyId=ICDO&conceptId=C15

 *   **OncoTree format expanded to support deeper tree nodes**
     * To support upcoming expansion of the OncoTree, the 5 named levels of the OncoTree {*Primary*, *Secondary*, *Tertiary*, *Quaternary*, *Quinternary*} have been dropped in favor of level numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}. Web API functions have been adjusted accordingly, and an API function which outputs a table format of the OncoTree has been adjusted to output 7 levels of depth.
