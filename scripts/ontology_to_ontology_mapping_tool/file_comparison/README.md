## Ontology to Ontology Mapping Tool

This tool helps compare existing OncoTree mapped ontologies against a reference OncoTree Codes file, and gives an output file named "missing_oncotree_codes.xlsx" that consist of a list of OncoTree codes that are missing from the inputted file. In order to use this tool, you must:
1.	Download the 'refrence_oncotree_codes.xlsx' file 
2.	Input an excel file that consists of OncoTree codes in column 1 and other ontology codes (UMLS, NCIT, SNOMED, ICDO Topography, HEMEONC, or ICDO Morphology) in the other columns. 

This tool MUST consist of OncoTree codes in column 1 to compare the two files. The output file will only give OncoTree codes that are missing from the file you inputted.
